        <h3>Working with GitHub Essay</h3>
       </center>
        <p>Html, although appearing simle to use at first, definitely has its challenges. For a new user specifically, this can take the form of learning how to format code or even just learning what the code is. I believe that GitHub is easier to use in terms of offering auto fill for coding as well as better consolidation of different webpages in oxygen. The only challenges that I ran into while programming using GitHub was using Git Bash to commit and push new files to the repo. This challenge quickly resolved itself in time though.</p>
        <p>Having good organizational skills and a decent grasp of coding and computer technology are all necessary skills for learning how to program on GitHub. Although, someone like me, who has no real coding experience can learn the skills necessary relatively quickly. Some skills I would like to learn to improve my website are how to add more styling to images and align them better in my gallery. Overall, my experience using GitHub has been a relatively positive one.</p>
